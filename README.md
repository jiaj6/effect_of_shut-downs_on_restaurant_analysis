# effect_of_shut-downs_on_restaurant_analysis

This repo is about exploring the effect of COVID shut-downs on restaurant businesses. We performed a randomized controlled trial and formed 2 groups: a control group where all restaurants are open, and a treatment group where all restaurants are shutdown. The sample is 1000 restaurants in Toronto. We randomly assign them to these 2 groups and conduct an online survey. We release the survey to a simulated field and get a simulated dataset, which contains the information about restaurants' current conditions during the pandemic. We plot relevant graphs to visualize the differences between these 2 groups to understand the effect of shut-downs on restaurant businesses. The analysis and paper are created in a fully reproducible way.

**Key findings** 
The shut-downs on some restaurants negatively affect their business management and financial positions. The shutdown restaurants tend to have a higher sales drop on average, and more of them feel unconfident in the management of businesses.

**This repo is organized as follows:**
